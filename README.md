# Base-Station

We are the team base-station.

> Our focus is on the charging of the robot and also maintaining the robot, by charging it and maybe updating it in times.
>  - Charging will be done with a contact pad and an arm that moves these pads to connect to the robot.
>  - Updating will be done by the same action, the pads all have a different function
>        The functions are;
>      - Charging, by using a ground and power pad.
>      - Data transfer.
>      - Powering on the Raspberry Pi for data transfers.
